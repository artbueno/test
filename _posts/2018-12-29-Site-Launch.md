So, the idea was that I would start a personal website as an easy challenge to both my creative and technical sides, to start the New Year off with. I was inspired after coming across Ali Spittel's beautiful [site](https://www.alispit.tel/#/)and decided to make a site of my own. (Of course, she is WAY above my level, technically and artistically, but I wanted to at least copy her general approach and tone.) Then I saw she had a blog on a separate domain, and I figured, why not imitate that too? At that moment, I realized I was actually committing to keeping up a blog, which is a committment I've made to myself and broken at least three previous times. This time feels different, somehow. Maybe the fact that I'm setting it up from "scratch" (really, just following Jonathan McGlone's handy [instructions](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) - thanks Jonathan) will compel me to consistently write, in the hopes of not wasting the time I invested into its setup? Or maybe because as long as I keep posting regularly, GitHub will fill in a bunch of green squares in my calendar grid and I'll look like some sort of developer rockstar from afar.

Well, I guess we'll see! Thanks for reading.
